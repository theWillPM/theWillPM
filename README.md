- 👋 Hi, I’m Will.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and gaming. I just graduated from my Software Development Diploma program with a 4.0 GPA @BowValleyCollege! I'm so excited!
- 🌱 I love working with React, Node, Web in general, Databases, C#, OOP and making games. If I had to chose, C# WPF with a solid design pattern like MVVM would be me top pick!!!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Well, anything I find interesting or challenging enough - Bonus if it involves games or learning something new.
- 📫 How to reach me: e-mail.

  I have decided to make all of my projects available - Even the bad ones! - so you can see how much I have improved over the past couple of years!
  Take a look and ask me about them!
