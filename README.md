- 👋 Hi, I’m Will.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and gaming. Currently enrolled in Software Development @BowValleyCollege. I intend to graduate with a 4.0 GPA (Only one term left!).
- 🌱 I love working with React, Node, Web in general, Databases, C#, OOP and making games!!! I  miss working with Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Well, anything I find interesting or challenging enough - Bonus if it involves games.
- 📫 How to reach me: e-mail.

  I have decided to make all of my projects available so you can see how much I have improved over the past couple of years!
  Take a look and ask me about them!
